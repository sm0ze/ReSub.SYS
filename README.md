# ReSub.SYS

A discord bot that changes a user's roles based on the enhancements they want, limited by their total XP. This XP is given based on a discord member's MEE6 XP + their TATSU XP and + their ReSub XP, given when members complete objectives with the bot.

Currently, users of this bot can gain XP and fight other members or generated opponents based on their stats. These stats are derived from their chosen enhancements.

The story this system comes from is "Iâ€™d Like to Change My Reincarnation Subscription, Please" created by Geminel who can be found [here.](https://geminel.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/fancy-seeing-you-here/)

This bot is created originally for Geminel's discord server, link found on their [WordPress page.](https://geminel.wordpress.com/2021/07/07/fancy-seeing-you-here/)

Current system enhancements and their prerequisites can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JIJjDzFjtuIU2k0jk1aHdMr2oErD_ySoFm7-iFEBOV0)
